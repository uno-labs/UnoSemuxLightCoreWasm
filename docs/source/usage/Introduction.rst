Introduction
============

This library is essentially intended to create various web versions of the Semux light :term:`HD Wallet`.
They can be used both to replace the standard wallet developed by the creators
of the `Semux core project <https://github.com/semuxproject/semux-core>`_,
as well as for various specialized applications (dApps) based on the Semux ecosystem.

A `wallet` is a tool for creating asymmetric key pairs and digital signatures for transactions in the Semux network.
It should have the following main features:

- Random mnemonic phrase generation;
- Creation or recovery an :term:`HD Account` based on a mnemonic phrase;
- Import a private key;
- Generating a random key pair (:term:`Address`);
- Deriving a sequence of key pairs (:term:`HD Addresses <HD Address>`) for the HD Account;
- Finding derived HD Addresses in HD Account;
- Finding :term:`non-HD Addresses <non-HD Address>` (imported or genearated);
- Generating a message for a transaction;
- Signing transaction messages.

In fact, a fully functional wallet must be able to perform many other functions.
Such as, for example, communication with a network node through its API
to obtain information necessary for the transaction, or
storing wallet data between user sessions in a browser.
The implementation of such advanced features is beyond the scope of this lightweight library,
designed to perform basic Semux-specific cryptographic operations in the JavaScript environment.

The specificity of Semux algorithms is that they use cryptography on elliptic curves `Ed25519`,
and this is why you canâ€™t use standard `Web Crypto API` present in modern browsers.
Fairly well-known `libSodium` library is most suitable for implementing the algorithms used in Semux.
This project makes heavy use of the libSodium.

Installation
------------

To build the project, QMake and EMSCRIPTEN compiler are used. The build process is quite complicated,
so the compiled files are laid out in the assets at the `release section <https://github.com/uno-labs/semux-light-core-wasm/releases>`_.

Download an archive ``uno_semux_light_core.tar.gz`` from assets on release page of this project.
Then unpack the archive into your project folder.

For use it in the browser project you have to import ``UnoSemuxLightCoreWasm.js`` into your HTML page: 

.. code-block:: html

    <script src="UnoSemuxLightCoreWasm.js"></script>
